# Learning_Cpp_PPP_3rdEdition_Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises from Bjarne Stroustrup’s book Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, 3rd (2024) edition.

Disclaimer
	•	These are my own solutions, created while learning and practicing the material.
	•	They are not meant to be a perfect or authoritative guide.
	•	The solutions follow the progression of the book, so:
	•	Exercises in earlier chapters may not always reflect the best or most idiomatic C++ practices learned later.
	•	Even if some solutions are not “ideal” in hindsight, they are still valid and functional within the context of the chapter they belong to.

Ongoing Work
	•	I will continue to add solutions for the remaining chapters as I progress through the book.
	•	Some existing solutions may also be refined or improved over time as my understanding of C++ deepens.

Technical Notes
	•	All code follows the C++20 standard.
	•	Solutions were compiled and run in a Visual Studio Code environment on macOS.
	•	Example compile & run command:
        g++ -std=c++20 -g path/to/file.cpp -o output_name && ./output_name
    	-	Replace path/to/file.cpp with the file you want to compile.
	    -	Replace output_name with the name you want for the executable.
    •   Compile & Run (Windows, using MinGW or similar)
        g++ -std=c++20 -g path\to\file.cpp -o output_name.exe
        .\output_name.exe
